# CustomFontsSAC

Demo repository to showcase usage of custom fonts in SAC.
The `gh-pages` branch hosts the SAP Fiori icon font released with [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/).

> **Note:** For demonstration purposes only, we use the `gh-pages` branch to host the custom font definition files. Be advised that this is **not recommended for productive use**. You can host the files similarly on any kind of webserver, though.
